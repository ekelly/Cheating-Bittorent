Cheating-Bittorent
==================

Our high level approach was implement propshare and focus on potential nasty messages.  We saw that clients in the Shark Tank were getting killed quite often, and we considered our first priority to be staying alive.  On the flip side, by hardening our client, we also came up with several ways to slow everybody else down, which we implemented.

To implement propshare, we first had to make a few modifications to the PeerCheckerTask, which periodically checks on the status of all clients and decides which clients to upload to (based on their performance in the past 20 seconds).  Now the PeerCheckerTask notices how much each client uploads, and then throttles each client to their share of our upload bandwidth.  The throttling is done by setting a rate on the output stream itself.  When the stream has sent the maximum number of bytes that the rate will allow, it sleeps for 1 second.

To harden our client, we first looked for vulnerabilities.  By far, the most vulnerable place is
